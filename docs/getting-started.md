The Research Software Directory can be found at:

On this page you will find links to the [research software](https://research-software-directory.org/software) recorded in the RSD, the
[research projects](https://research-software-directory.org/projects) in which this software was used or developed, and the
[organisations](https://research-software-directory.org/organisations) who contributed to this software.

All information recorded in the RSD about software, projects and organisations is public, since our goal is to show the impact and
promote the visibility and reuse of research software. Anyone can browse through this information and it is indexed by search engines.
