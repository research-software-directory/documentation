If you sign in to the RSD for the first time, the identify provider may ask you permission to share information with the RSD.

### Signing in with SURFConext

employees of these organisations to sign in to the RSD using their institute credentials. Before they can do so, however, an organisation __must enable the RSD service__ in their
SURFconext dashboard.

the RSD administrators.

::: tip
Please [contact us](mailto:rsd@esciencecenter.nl) if you wish to use your ORCID to sign in to the RSD.
